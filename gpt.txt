**Q: How far can these vehicles travel on a single charge?**
A: Range varies by model from 25-50 miles per charge. Entry-level models like TURFMAN 100 offer 25 miles, most standard models provide 30-40 miles, and premium models like the D6 MAX XT4 can achieve up to 50 miles per charge.

**Q: How long does charging take?**
A: Charging time depends on battery voltage: 36V models charge in 3-4 hours, 48V models take 4-6 hours, 72V models require 6-8 hours, and 96V premium models need 8-10 hours for a complete charge.

### Problem-Solution Training Pairs for GPT

**Problem:** "My golf cart won't start"
**Solution:** Check battery charge level first. If batteries are charged, inspect all electrical connections for corrosion or looseness. Test the key switch and check the main fuse. If these are good, the issue may be a faulty solenoid or motor controller requiring professional service.

**Problem:** "The cart is running slower than normal"
**Solution:** This usually indicates battery aging, incorrect tire pressure, or overloading. Check tire pressure first (should be manufacturer recommended PSI), reduce cargo/passenger load if excessive, and have batteries tested for capacity loss. Cold weather can also reduce performance temporarily.

**Problem:** "My cart won't charge"
**Solution:** Verify the charger is plugged in properly and the outlet has power. Check the charging port for damage or debris. If the charger doesn't turn on, the charger itself may be faulty. If it turns on but doesn't charge, battery connections may be loose or batteries may need replacement.

**Problem:** "I need a cart for my business"
**Solution:** For commercial use, consider payload capacity, durability, and daily usage requirements. The DENAGO ROVER series offers heavy-duty construction and high payload capacity. EVOLUTION TURFMAN models are designed specifically for commercial maintenance work. We offer fleet pricing and service packages for businesses.

**Problem:** "Which cart is best for families?"
**Solution:** EVOLUTION RANGER series models are ideal for families, offering 4 or 6-passenger seating with safety features and comfortable ride quality. The D5 RANGER 4 PLUS provides excellent value for families of four, while the D5 RANGER 6 PLUS accommodates larger families or groups.
